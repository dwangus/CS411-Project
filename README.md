To view, run /project/bin/app.py

Risk It For the Biscuit is a proof-of-concept website that allows university students to invest in budding startups at their same university. For now, this website simply allows startups to input their own contact information and pitch, and allows students to look up various startups at BU, find more information about them, and email the startup directly.

Screenshots can be found in the /screenshots folder.

The framework used here was Web.py, with a MySQL database back-end connected with a Python driver.
